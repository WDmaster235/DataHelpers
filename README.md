# Welcome to **DataHelpers** 🚀

**DataHelpers** is here to solve the tricky, everyday problems that many programmers face while using C#. 

You might often find yourself spending hours on tasks that don’t have simple solutions, such as managing complex collections, navigating through specific algorithms, or writing custom utilities to improve performance. That’s where **DataHelpers** comes in! 💡

With **DataHelpers**, we take care of these problems under the hood with new data structures and helper functions. All you need to do is call a simple function, and we’ll handle the rest for you!

Our goal is to keep your code clean, simple, and efficient, while **we** manage the hard stuff. 😉

## How Does It Work?

Imagine you need to manage a custom data structure that C# doesn't natively support. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, you can simply rely on **DataHelpers** to provide a clean, easy-to-use interface while we do the complex stuff behind the scenes.

- **Simple APIs**: Just call the functions! No need to understand the intricate details.
- **Optimized for Performance**: We ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate new data structures into your project.

## How to Add Your Own Class to the Library 📚

Want to contribute or add your custom class to the **DataHelpers** library? Great! Here’s a simple step-by-step tutorial:

### Step 1: Fork the Repo

1. Navigate to the **DataHelpers** GitHub repository.
2. Click on the **Fork** button at the top right of the screen to create a copy of the repository under your own account.

### Step 2: Clone the Repo Locally

Once you’ve forked the repo:

1. Open a terminal or Git client.
2. Run the following command to clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataHelpers.git
   ```
### Step 3: Create a New Class 🛠️

1. Inside the `src` folder, create a new class file for your data structure or helper function. Name it something meaningful, for example: `MyCustomStructure.cs`.

2. Add your class definition in the file. Make sure your class is well-documented using XML comments for easy integration into the library's documentation.

   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// A custom data structure that solves a specific problem.
   /// </summary>
   public class MyCustomStructure
   {
       // Your custom logic here
   }
   ```
### Step 5: Add Unit Tests 🧪

We love code that works, and testing is key!

1. Go to the `Tests` folder and create a test class for your newly added structure or helper.
2. Write unit tests to ensure your class behaves as expected. Use a testing framework like xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.

   Example:

   ```csharp
   public class MyCustomStructureTests
   {
       [Fact]
       public void Test_MyCustomStructure_Behavior()
       {
           // Arrange
           var structure = new MyCustomStructure();

           // Act
           var result = structure.SomeMethod();

           // Assert
           Assert.Equal(expected, result);
       }
   }
   ```
### Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes

1. Once you've added the class and written the tests, commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added MyCustomStructure to the DataHelpers library"
   ```
2. Push your changes to your GitHub fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request (PR) 📝

1. Go back to the **DataHelpers** GitHub page.
2. You’ll see an option to create a pull request. Click on it.
3. Add a meaningful title and description to your PR and submit it for review.

Once your pull request is approved and merged, your class will be a part of the **DataHelpers** library! 🎉
